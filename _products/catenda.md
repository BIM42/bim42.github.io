Catenda is a BIM collaboration tool with support for all the buildingSMART standards (IFC, bSDD, BCF, COBie). It comes with a range of APIs for easy implementation into your own software.

The Catenda add-in for Revit allows you to visualize, create, and edit issues seamlessly from within Revit. 

All your issues are synchronized in real-time between Revit and Catenda, letting you access, share, and communicate issues. The issue format is BCF so that the issues can be shared across any BCF enabled BIM software or platform.

You can also export and upload your Revit model directly to Catenda in one click.

Features include:

Access to all your Catenda projects
Filter and manage issues across issue boards
Create new issues directly from Revit
Locate issues in your Revit model
Create a new 3D view for each comment
Add pictures in your issues and annotate them
Assign issues to other project members
Change issue status and other properties
Upload your Revit model as IFC to Catenda
